# JoJos-React-Adventures
A single page memory game application built with React.js. 

The goal is the click as many portraits as possible while never clicking a portrait more than once. Portraits will continue to chnage position as you click. Your score will continue to tally up and will automatically reset onece you guess wrong. Your high score will continue to be tracked as long as you have the page open.
